  Hi, my name's Deep Inder Mohan, and I'm a CS Ph.D. student at the [School of Cybersecurity and Privacy](https://scp.cc.gatech.edu/), located in the Georgia Institute of Technology.  My field of interest is <mark>Cryptography</mark>, including both Theoretical and Applied Cryptography. Specifically, I am interested in problems relating to secure outsourced computation and authentication. I am being advised at Georgia Tech by Professors [Sasha Boldyreva](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~aboldyre/) and [Joseph Jaeger](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~josephjaeger/)

          Generic and Algebraic Computation Models: When AGM Proofs Transfer to the GGM

          The Fuchsbauer, Kiltz, and Loss (Crypto 2018) claim that (some) hardness results in the algebraic group model imply the same hardness results in the generic group model was recently called into question by Katz, Zhang, and Zhou (Asiacrypt 2022). The latter gave an interpretation of the claim under which it is incorrect. We give an alternate interpretation under which it is correct, using natural frame- works for capturing generic and algebraic models for arbitrary algebraic structures. Most algebraic analyses in the literature can be captured by our frameworks, making the claim correct for them.

        title: Modeling Prejudice and Its Effect on Societal Prosperity
        link: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17477778.2022.2039570

          Published in the Taylor & Francis Journal of Simulation. Co-authors: Arjun Verma, Shrisha Rao

          Existing studies of the multi-group dynamics of prejudiced societies focus on the social-psychological knowledge behind the relevant processes. Instead, we create a multi-agent framework that simulates the propagation of prejudice and measures its tangible impact on prosperity. Our simulations show that even modeling prejudice as an exclusively out-group phenomenon nonetheless generates implicit in-group promotion, leading to higher relative prosperity of a prejudiced population. This model is a step towards a deeper understanding of the origins, propagation, and ramifications of prejudice through simulative studies grounded in apt theoretical backgrounds.

        title: Brute-Force Resistant Biometric Cryptosystem
        # link: github.com/deep-guy/interviewQG
        # link_text: Project Website

          (Ongoing) In collaboration with Sasha Boldyreva & Tianxin Tang
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Our objective is to create a biometrics-based key retrieval system that does not require users to remember any additional secrets beyond their biometrics, and yet achieves security against brute-force biometric attackers.

          Master's thesis @ IIITB under the supervision of Prof. Srinivas Vivek
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Foundational ID systems such as SSN and AADHAR can be critical to the effective governance of a nation. Since these systems deal with data that is inherently critical, securing this data becomes paramount. This poses a challenge to smaller nations, that do not have the resources to set up in-house servers to run these systems. In this project, we develop a Homomorphic Encryption based system that allows nations to levarage (potentially) untrusted third-party servers for storing and processing user data while ensuring that this data would remain secure - even if the third-party is breached. The accepted thesis can be found [here](documents/DeepInder-Thesis.pdf). This work was also presented by Prof. Srinivas Vivek in the Turing foundation's Trustworthy Digital Identity Conference held in London, U.K. on Sept. 16, 2022.

    layout: text
    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      Alongside my interests in Cryptography and Privacy research, I am also an avid debator. I have won multiple [competitions](https://twitter.com/iiitb_official/status/1100074139287777280) at the school and college level for debates and extempores, and have also served as the head of the Debate Society, IIIT Bangalore. 

      I also am a proficient MC, and have been the host for multiple events in IIITB, most notable of which is TEDxIIITBangalore, in 2018.
